# sudoku_solver
 Program that uses a saturation restriction algorithm to solve any possible Sudoku really fast (it's still under development!)
 
 For more information about the algorithm used, check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X
 
 Nexts steps in this project:
 - Define a form of input of the Sudoku's grids (currently, the grid has to be inserted manually inside the code). I was thinking of something in the area of extracting the grid from a photo using image processing.
 - Document better the code (it's kinda messy with lots of magic numbers to implement the matrix used in the algorithm)
